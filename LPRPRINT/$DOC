This dataset contains 2 ISPF dialogs and an ISPF Edit Command:

LPREDIT  - ISPF Edit command to invoke LPRPRINT on the current
           data (be sure to save first)
LPRPRINT - used to print using the z/OS TCP/IP LPR command to
           any system with a LPD server.  This includes intelligent
           printers which have LPD built-in.  All ISPF Elements are
           inline within the EXEC.
PSPRINT  - used to format host output for printing on a PostScript
           printer and then invoke LPRPRINT.  Options include Portrait,
           Landscape, and 2UP printing.

The members of this dataset are in IEBUPDTE format.

$DOC     - What you are reading
EXEC     - The above 2 rexx execs which are the entry points to the dialogs
MSGS     - ISPF messages for PSPRINT
PANELS   - ISPF panels, including brief tutorials, for PSPRINT

No warranty comes with these dialogs - use them at your own risk.  They
may require customization to work in your environment.
