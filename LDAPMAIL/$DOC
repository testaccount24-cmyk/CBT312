LDAPMAIL is a simple ISPF dialog to query a ldap server, using a
supplied name, for an e-mail address.

The members of this PDS are:

$DOC     - what you are reading
LDAPMAIL - the rexx exec
LDAPMLP  - ISPF Panel for prompting
LDAPMLT  - ISPF Panel for the table display of the results

Installation:

1. Copy members LDAPMLP and LDAPMLT into your ISPF Panel data set
2. Copy member LDAPMAIL into your rexx data set
3. Customize LDAPMAIL for your installation
4. Verify that GLD.SGLDLNK is in your linklist (this is the LDAP
   load module library)
5. You may be required to define GLDSRCH to your sites security
   systems TSO command table

Customization issues:
1. You may need to update the LDAPMLP panel if your ldap information
   is not of the format First Last.
2. If the results of your ldap query are not being processed
   properly you may need to tailor the parse statement in the
   LDAPMAIL exec.
   From: parse value work with "cn="ename ",ou=" .
   To:   something that works for you.

Then invoke by executing the rexx exec (e.g. TSO %LDAPMAIL)
