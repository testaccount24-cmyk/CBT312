Overview

ISPFCMDS is a utility ISPF command that eases the task of adding
installation or user commands to an active ISPF command table. This
can eliminaate the requirement to customize the IBM provided ISPCMDS
command table or to create elaborate Site or User ISPF command tables.

Syntax

The syntax for calling ISPFCMDS is:

   %ISPFCMDS table verb truncation action

Where:

  table is USER to add the command to the User ISPF Command table
           SITE to add the command to the Site ISPF Command table
           ISPF to add the command to the ISPCMDS ISPF Command table
                note that this option is not recommended
           * to add the command to one of the following tables
             in this order:
             1) USER
             2) SITE
             3) the active Application command table if there is one
             4) ISPCMDS

  verb  is the name of the command to add to the table. This must
        be from 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters.

  truncation is the number of characters which the command can be
        abbreviated or 0 to indicate no abbreviation is allowed.

  action is a valid ISPF Select command

Notes:

  1. If the requested command already exists in the table then
     the command will be replaced.
  2. Syntax and error messages will be generated as appropriate.
  3. This command must be executed under ISPF.
  4. Some installations will define in the ISPF configuration a User
     command table prefix but not create a User command table. It is
     recommended that a User command table be created with zero or a
     limited number of entries and placed in the same library as the
     Site command table as that will allow this tool to dynamically
     update the User table.

Sample usage:

   /* rexx */

   /* set a short alias of DD for DDLIST/ISRDDN */
   "%ispfcmds user dd 0 alias ddlist"

   /* assumes that Lionel Dyck's Fastpath command has been
      installed in your SYSEXEC or SYSPROC library concatenation */
   "%ispfcmds user fastpath 0 select cmd(%fastpath)"

   /* assumes that Doug Nadel's TASID has been installed into
      a STEPLIB or your Linklist */
   "%ispfcmds user tasid 2 select cmd(tasid)"

   /* assumes that the IBM supplied ISRBPDF and ISREPDF
      have been copied as BPDF and EPDF into your SYSEXEC or
      SYSPROC library concatenation */
   "%ispfcmds user br 0 select cmd(%bpdf &zparm)"
   "%ispfcmds user ed 0 select cmd(%epdf &zparm)"
