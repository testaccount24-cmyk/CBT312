Have you ever found a tool, utility, application, or command that you
didn't know  you needed but once you find it you use it multiple
times a day and can't imagine not having it before?

Well RUNC and ERC are two of those.

What is RUNC?  It is an ISPF Edit command (macro to be exact) that
will invoke any TSO or ISPF command that is found within the data
currently being Edited (or Viewed) under ISPF.

What is ERC? It is an ISPF command that opens your command dataset,
and/or member, from any ISPF Panel. It is a fast path to your commands.

So what you might say.  Well consider this:

You issue TSO commands and start ISPF applications all day long if
you're like most ISPF users. Some percentage of these are not on any
ISPF menu and thus require that you remember not only the command
but the syntax.

What if you could place those commands within a dataset, either in a
single dataset/member, or multiple datasets/members, and then be
able to select the specific commands, or commands, to be executed?
And what if you could also code the commands in that data with
symbolics that would then cause an ISPF panel to be displayed
prompting for the values for those symbolics?

What you'd have is a collection of your frequently, and
infrequently, used TSO and ISPF commands that you can access from
any ISPF Edit or View session.

Then, to add to the fun, you can insert comments to document the
commands.

And, just for more fun, you can insert these commands as comments
within JCL.

It doesn't slice/dice/chop or cut - but it comes with no shipping or
handling fee and the price is zero dollars and zero cents.
