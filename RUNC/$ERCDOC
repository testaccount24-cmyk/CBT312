The ERC command is an optional command that will open a dataset that is
defined with members containing commands in ISPF View (or Edit)

ERC must have been installed and be defined in the ISPF command table so
that it can be entered on any ISPF command line.

The first time the ERC command is used the user will be presented with
an ISPF panel to enter the dataset name where the user has members with
commands.

Syntax is:   ERC
             ERC member-name          (e.g. ABC)
             ERC member-name-mask     (e.g. AB*, %BC, A%C)
             ERC /SET
             ERC -E member-name       (e.g. ABC)
             ERC ?

When entered with a ? then a short ISPF tutorial will be presented.

When entered without a member-name then the command dataset will be
opened in ISPF Edit or View.

When a member-name is specified then that member is opened in ISPF Edit
or View.

When a member-name-mask is used then only those members that match the
mask will be presented in the member list of ISPF Edit. The mask must
conform to the ISPF Edit mask ( % and * )

When the /SET is specified the user will be presented with a ISPF Panel
to change or define the command dataset.

When the -E option is used then the command dataset is opened in ISPF Edit.

The reason for using View as the default is to allow a shared command dataset.

If the command dataset is prefixed with the active users userid then the
default action will be Edit instead of View.
