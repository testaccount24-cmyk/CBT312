The RUNC ISPF Edit Command is only used within ISPF Edit, or View, and
will execute any ISPF Edit, OMVS, TSO, (E)JES, SDSF, or ISPF command
found on the selected records within the active ISPF Edit data.

Syntax:  RUNC options member

options may be:

           blank (default)
           ? or HELP to display ISPF tutorial
           n - must be the first option and will skip
               the first n characters to find the command
          -A or -ALL enables all records to be considered for commands
          -B to browse the results using STEMEDIT
          -BS to toggle the prompt for the RUNC supported symbolics
          -C to display all log datasets (ISPF 3.4 list)
          -D to insert the message as Data
       or -D(prefix) where prefix is added to the beginning of the data
             followed by a space
          -I to display the messages after each individual command
          -L to log all messages to a log dataset (type based on install default
          -LD to log all messages to a sequential log dataset
          -LP to log all messages to a partitioned dataset member
          -LX to disable logging if logging was enabled via -O user defaults
          -N to insert the message as NOTELINEs
          -O to display the user default options panel
          -R to change the default Report from the site default
             of either Always generate a report regardless if the
             command generates a message or not or Only report if
             messages were generated.
          -S nnn to stop multiple command execution if the return code
             is greater than nnn
          -T to not trap and let the results go to screen
          -V to view the results using STEMEDIT
              default is to View
          -W nnn to wrap the inserted text (for -D and -N) and the
             when the command response is inserted. If nnn is W then
             the wrap value will be set to the current Edit data width.
             The wrap will occur at the closest blank or exact character
             location depending on the data.

          ONLY(string) will search for the string (e.g. xyz) in
             the command string and if not found will ignore that
             command.
          PREFIX(string) will append the string to the front of
             each command.
          SUFFIX(string) will append the string to the end of
             each command.

          ** PREFIX and SUFFIX apply only to TSO commands

member, if provided, is a member name or member mask. If a member name
then that member is opened in Edit, or View. If a member mask then the
member list will be displayed using that mask.

Both options and member are optional

   <DOC>:           Documentation Popup
                    <DOC> end with </DOC>
                    <TITLE>Title for Popup
   <EXIT rc>:       Test return code after previous command and if
                    equal or greater will cease RUNC processing.
   <START>:         Defines the start of a range within the data to
                    process. Ends with <END> statement. Both must
                    be on records by themselves.

   Documentation format
             1. <DOC> on a record by itself starts the doc section
             2. </DOC> on a record by itself ends the doc section
             3. <TITLE> followed by up to 32 characters on the same
                record and between <DOC> and </DOC> records will
                be used for the title of the documentation popup.
             4. PF3 will close the popup and continue with the next
                command(s)
             5. CANCEL on the command line will close the popup and
                terminate RUNC processing

Usage Notes: 1. Select records with TSO commands using line tags, C, C#,
                or CC and CC.
             2. Use the command option of -ALL, or -A,  to process all
                records for commands.
             3. Data lines starting with *, /*, //, or //* or all blank
                will be ignored
                - use n to skip over *, /* , //, or //*
                - EXCLUDED records will also be ignored
                  ** This applies as well if an EDIT X ALL happens :-)
             4. Commands may be continued on the next record by using a
                + at the end of the command for the record
             5. The data on the line will be executed using the Address
                TSO command as a TSO command, or ADDRESS ISPExec for
                ISPF commands. For omvs the command will be executed
                using bpxwunix. For SDSF and (E)JES the appropriate
                commands will be used.
             6. Commands can be in any record in the data.
             7. Symbolics are supported in the command using the syntax
                of &symbol. An ISPF panel will be generated to prompt
                for the symbolic values.
             8. Hint: Use a symbolic at the end to allow entry of
                additional command options
             9. Multiple symbolics may be used in the same command and
                may be delineated by '<>(),."; $#&Ý¨{}/\%-_
            10. If a symbolic ends with a . then the . will be removed
                and the symbolic value will be merged with the adjacent
                text.
            11. OMVS commands are any valid OMVS command. Multiple
                commands are separated by a ;. And if SuperUser
                is required us su.
            12. EDIT, EJES and SDSF will accept multiple commands that
                are separated by a ;.
            13. -W is used with -D and -N to wrap the text that is
                inserted into the command member or dataset. This is
                useful if the command results would be truncated when
                inserted.
            14. The command members may have ISPF Edit sequence numbers,
                or not, depending on the users preference. RUNC will
                ignore them providing they are valid Edit numbers.
            15. -N and -D override -B, -I, -T, and -V
            16. -B, -T, and -V over-ride -R
            17. Comments may be included on the same record as a command
                and must start after the command and begin with a /* and
                there is no need for a closing */.
            18. When Browse/Edit/View a Member the active dataset and
                volser is implied.
            19. The Rename command requires a volser. Use * to use the
                cataloged data set.

 Sample Usage:

    Create a member in a dataset:

    LISTD &dsn
    LISTC ENT(&dsn) ALL
    PDS &dsn
    PDS MY.EXEC
    SELECT PANEL(&panel)
    SELECT PANEL(ISR@PRIM) +
           opt(&opt)
    EJES D A,ALL
    EJES ST jobname
    SDSF D A,ALL
    SDSF ST jobname
    OMVS cd /u;ls -la
    CONS d a,l
    EDIT c &from &to all
    EDIT only yyy
    EDIT Dataset(&dsname)
    EDIT Dataset(&dsname) Volume(&volser)
    BROWSE Dataset(&dsname)
    BROWSE Dataset(&dsname) Volume(&volser)
    VIEW Dataset(&dsname)
    VIEW Dataset(&dsname) Volume(&volser)

Then use the RUNC command on that dataset/member and use the row
selection commands to select the record(s) to process.

The symbolics in the sample commands will bring up an ISPF panel that
will prompt the user to enter a value for each symbolic in the order
that they are found within the command. If the user decided to not
execute the current command at this point they may do so by entering
CANCEL on the ISPF command line.
