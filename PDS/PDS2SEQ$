     A rexx program to put a pds in sequential format

I use my PC as a "data store" , where i have anything on it
(Manuals, Redbooks, documents, presentations ...). And with the
help of a search software (Archivarius seems to be the best
search software that i've found after multiple tests), I am
able to find anything on my PC (A sort of Google search on my
PC).

So, it is interesting for me to be able to retrieve data that
are on PDS from my search software.  This Rexx reads a PDS, puts
it in a sequential format , so I can ftp it on my PC. It
provides also jcl that you can use to reload the sequential into
a PDS format.

It is adapted from a Rexx that I've found on the web
