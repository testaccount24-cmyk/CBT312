Here is a version of LSTPROC that works with JES3.  I could have
made it by-JES but decided to have a separate one.

LSTPROC3 dynamically determines the system level PARMLIBs, PROCLIBs,
and JES3 Disk Reader datasets. Allocated them to $... DD's and then
invokes ISRDDN with the parm of ONLY $* to just display those DD's.
Upon return from ISRDDN the DD's are released.  The PROCLIB's and
Disk Readers are determined by looking in the JES3 initialization
deck.

Cheers my friend
