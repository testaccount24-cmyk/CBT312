New tool:   ONCALL

I have a new tool that is on my beta page that you all might find
interesting.  It will generate an oncall rotation for your group
and optionally e-mail (using xmitip) the rotation list along with
an icalendar file that can be used to add the oncall information
to each individuals calendar.

This is a beta but it does work reasonably well (we are using it
in several of our groups).
