//*        This REXX helps solve the problem of which DASD volumes  *   FILE 312
//*        connected to your system, contain IPL text, and what     *   FILE 312
//*        IPL text do they contain?                                *   FILE 312

//*        You don't have to dump Track 0 for ALL of your volumes,  *   FILE 312
//*        but you can FILTER the volser's for strings with volume  *   FILE 312
