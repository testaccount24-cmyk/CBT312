               Exec

Installation recommendations:

1. copy the fastpath from the exec into a exec library concatenated to
   your sysexec or sysproc dd
2. review the fastpath customization option (find *custom*)
   - do you want to leave the ISPF Panels imbedded in the exec or
     do you want to extract them
     - copy the EXTISPF exec into your exec/clist library
     - edit the fastpath member and enter EXTISPF hlq on the command line
       - hlq is where the panels pds will be created
         hlq.PANELS
       - copy the hlq.PANELS members into your ISPPLIB dataset
       - Edit FastPath to change the customization variable to 0 to
         disable loading the panels dynamically
3. Copy the FASTPATH exec into your production rexx or clist library
4. update an ispf command table:
   Verb      T  Action
