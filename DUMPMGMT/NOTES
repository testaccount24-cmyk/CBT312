Miscelleanous notes:

1. Setup in SYS1.PARMLIB member COMMNDxx
   COM='DD NAME=SVCDUMP.&SYSNAME..&JOBNAME..D&LYYMMDD..T&LHHMMSS..S&SEQ.'

2. Setup Automation to trap on message:
   IEA611I COMPLETE DUMP ON dump.data.set.name

3. Have automation issue command:
   S SVCDMPLG,DUMP=dump.data.set.name

4. Have automation run command %DMPIPLCK after each IPL

5. Have automation run command %DUMPLOGX every day at 23:55 to purge
   obsolete dumps

6. Tailor DUMPLOGX exec for your own dump retention/purge rules

7. Tailor DUMPLOGP exec to do the notifications per your installation.

8. Alloc a sequential data set for your dumplog and tailor the exec's
   with this data set name.
   - Allocate the dumplog data set RECFM=FB LRECL=155 DSORG=PS
   - copy member dumplog into this dataset to 'prime' it
     (be sure to delete the sample data set)

9. View the dumplog under ISPF using the command DUMPINDX

10. Get and install the XMITIP package if you wish to do notifications
    via e-mail (http://www.geocities.com/lbdyck)

11. Get and install the FTPBatch package if you wish to be able to
    send dumps via FTP to a vendor or other support group
    (http://www.geocities.com/lbdyck)

12. Get and install the IBM tool TRSMAIN if you wish to Terse (compress)
    your dumps before you ftp them.
    (ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/s390/mvs/tools/packlib/)

13. Update exec BLSGSTRT to conform to your installations startup of IPCS

14. Review the exec's for NJE Node information as the dumplog data set
    (currently) is allocated based upon the current nje node.
