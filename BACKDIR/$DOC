                 Generalized OMVS Directory Backup Utility

/usr/local/bin/backup_dir.rex is a generalized backup utility designed to
backup an entire directory by making a copy of the directory, and all
subdirectories, into a date stamped directory.

Usage: backup_dir.rex is intended to be invoked under a cron task

   * ------------------------------------------------------ *
   * cron table updating  (IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ASK)          *
   *                                                        *
   *   Must be superuser                                    *
   *   Issue:  crontab -e -u OMVSKERN                       *
   *   - opens the cron table in OEDIT (standard ISPF Edit) *
   *   - do NOT allow a cron entry across multiple records  *
   *   - BE VERY CAREFUL                                    *
   *   - save and close                                     *

Sample Crontab entry (shifted for comments)

     # run daily 5 minutes after midnight
     5 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_dir.rex parmfile
               /usr/local/bin/backup_dir.parmfile >
               /tmp/xxx.backup.log

The syntax is demonstrated in the cron entry:

  /usr/local/bin/backup_dir.rex is the command

  /usr/local/bin/backup_dir.parmfile is the filename for the processing parms

  > is a pipe that directs all messages to the next file

  /tmp/xxx.backup.log is where any messages from the backup process will
  be logged.

The parmfile must be of the format (shifted over for readability):

    Notes: A sample parmfile can be found in /usr/local/bin/backup_dir.parm
           The keywords are case insensitive

  # Dir backup parmfile
  #
  #DirLoc is the directory to be backed up
  #
  DirLoc      /u/bozo/
  #
  #BackupDir is the directory to backup to
  #          if this directory does not exist then
  #          it will be created
  #
  BackupDir   /backup/backup_bozo/
  #
  #History is the number of iterations to keep
  #
  History     5
  #

Sample Backup structure:
BackUpDir   /u/ssh2_backup

backup directories under BackUpDir:
backup_d170701
backup_d170702
backup_d170703
backup_d170704
backup_d170705

Note: if there are multiple backups during the same date then the new
backup directory will have a .thhmm suffix.
