EMAC is an ISPF Edit macro that will present the ISPF Edit user with a
list of available Edit Macros in an ISPF Table. The user can then select
(S) a macro to execute or display the help (H) information for the
macro.

Members in this dataset:

     $DOC    - what you are reading
     $USERDOC- short doc for your users
     $RECV   - execute this to do a TSO RECEIVE on the EXEC member
     EXEC    - TSO Transmit format of the distribution EXEC library
             - EMAC  - the ISPF Edit macro
                       ** Customize the reference to the
                       ** EMACD control file
             - EMACD - the control file with information on the
                       ISPF Edit macros you plan to make available
                       to your users.  Edit/tailor using info included
                       in the sample data provided.

Site customization:

The EMACD sample must be used as a model and placed into a sequential
dataset, or a PDS member, and then the EMAC Exec updated (find *custom*)
to point to it.

Note:

That EMAC includes 5 ISPF panels that are imbedded within the EMAC code
and dynamically loaded as needed when executed.
