OMVSCOPY - The Package

This PDS contains the following members:

OMVSCOPY  - The ISPF front-end to the TSO OCOPY Command
OCOPYO    - Sample JCL to copy from OMVS file to z/OS data set
OCOPYZ    - Sample JCL to copy from z/OS data set to OMVS file

OMVSCOPY is an ISPF front-end to the TSO OCOPY command designed to make
it easy to copy an z/OS data set to an OMVS file and vice versa.

OMVSCOPY supports both foreground and batch execution. When the Batch
option is selected, it will dynamically generate the batch JCL and allow
the user to Edit it prior to submission, or the user can copy the JCL to
a permanent JCL data set for modification and reuse.

Among the capabilities of OMVSCOPY are:

1. copy a z/OS data set to an OMVS file
2. copy an OMVS file to a z/OS data set
3. supports an ISPF 3.17 like interface to find and select the
   desired OMVS file to copy
4. supports a ISPF 3.4 like interface to find and select the
   desired z/OS data set to copy
5. supports a member selection list interface to find and select
   the desired PDS member to copy
6. Foreground and Batch execution is supported with the Batch mode
   generating JCL, presented under ISPF Edit, to the user to submit
   or to copy for later use.
7. supports superuser if the user is enabled to use it.

While using the ISPF dialog the input supports special processing:

   - hlq.xxx.*    Results in a selection list of available data sets
   - hlq.xxx.pds  Results in a selection list of members
   - /u/          Results in a selection list of OMVS files
                  similar to ISPF 3.17

When in the OMVS file selection display the user can use L to open a
directory, including using L on the .. directory to move up one level.
The CD command may also be used to go directy to a directory. And the ~
may be used to indicate the users home directory.

The sample JCL members are for those who prefer to do the copy in batch.
