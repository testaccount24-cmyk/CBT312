This package is an ONCALL scheduling tool to assist in building
an oncall rotation.

The package must be installed via the RECEIVE member of this library to
recreate the exec and panel libraries.

You can use the ONCALL member to dynamically access the application.

Note: It requires the XMITIP 4.88 or newer package if you wish to use
the option to e-mail the generated report.
