GENSUB - A Generalized ISPF Job Submission Dialog

This application is a generalized REXX application intended to standardize
and simplify the submission of jobs from within an ISPF application. To
use it the ISPF dialog developer inserts into a CLIST or REXX application
the call to the GENSUB application after generating the Batch JCL to be
submitted.
Syntax:  %gensub jcl-dsn

The user will then be presented with 4 options:

     B - Browse the generated JCL
     E - Edit the generated JCL
     S - Submit the generated JCL
     C - Cancel the GENSUB process

To install this application execute the RECEIVE member of this installation
partition data set:

     EX install.pds(receive)

Then follow the prompts to restore the EXEC and PANELS members, which are
in TSO Transmit format, into real data sets.  Then copy these data sets
into libraries in your ISPF TSO library concatenation.
