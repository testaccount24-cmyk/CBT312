CHKIKJ is a quick/dirty ispf dialog to compare the ibm samplib
version of ikjtso00 to what is actually running on the active lpar.

Why use it?

    1. To determine what changes IBM has made in their sample IKJTSO00
       that SHOULD be reflected in the production IKJTSOxx
    2. To review the active IKJTSOxx to audit for modules that are
       defined (and thus authorized) and which may not be required
       any longer in the list.

The ISPF panels (panel and tutorial) that is used is contained within
the REXX code.

The tail end of the exec, started at the >DATA record, are the
module descriptions that are used in the report.

This pds contains the rexx exec CHKIKJ and the $DOC (that you're reading)

The requirements are:
1. Must have STEMEDIT installed and available if not specifying a report
   dataset name.  STEMEDIT can be found on CBTTape File 183.
2. Must be able to read SYS1.SAMPLIB
2. Must be able to invoke the TSO PARMLIB command

The report isn't pretty but it works
