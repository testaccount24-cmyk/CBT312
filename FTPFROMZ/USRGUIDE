=============================================================================
Overview

FTPFromZ is a TSO command written in REXX designed to provide a simple
command line interface to the z/OS FTP service. Using FTPFromZ the user
can initiate the file transfer of a data set from the z/OS system to
another z/OS system or any other system which is running a FTP Server.

With FTPFromZ both sequential data sets and members of partitioned data
sets can be transferred easily. For partitioned data sets (PDS)
transfers the user can specify one or more members with or without
member name masking (e.g. member*). When sending from z/OS to a non-z/OS
system the user can specify either text mode or binary mode transfer of
the data while for z/OS transfers the transfer will occur in EBCDIC,
which supports any z/OS data (text or binary).

FTPFromZ can be executed while logged into TSO, under ISPF, or in batch
using the batch Terminal Monitor Program (TMP).

=============================================================================
Syntax

The syntax of the command is:

    %ftpfromz options

Where the supported options are:

DIR
    Defines the remote directory into which the transferred data set
    will be stored.

    e.g. DIR \fromz\work

DSN
    Defines the z/OS data set name that is to be transferred. The
    data set may be either a sequential data set or a partitioned
    data set (PDS), with or without a member name. If no member
    name is specified then the MEM option must be used to define
    the member(s) to transfer. Generation data group (gdg) data sets
    are supported.

    e.g. DSN hlq.test.report
         DSN hlq.test.pds
         DSN hlq.test.pds(mem)
         DSN hlq.test.*
         DSN hlq.test(-1)

    Note if masking is used (*) then only sequential data sets are
    supported.

FILE
    Remote file name to be used in place of the source data set name
    * default is to use the DSN value

    e.g. FILE test.report

    Note: if the target data set is a GDG then the base GDG must already
          be defined.

HOST
    Remote host name to receive the FTP

    e.g. HOST your.local.server

MEM
    Member or (Members) of the PDS to FTP

    e.g. MEM member
         MEM member*
         MEM (mema memb memc)
         MEM (mema* memc*)

MEMSUF
    Defines a file suffix for a member (e.g. .txt).
    Does not work if member masking is used.

NETRC
    FTP NETRC file with hostname, userid, and
        password
    * required if USERID and PASSWORD keywords
      are not specified in the command
    * NETRC is more secure as the data set can
      be restricted by security access rules
    * NETRC file format is:
      MACHINE hostname LOGIN userid PASSWORD password

    e.g. NETRC data-set-name

NETRCDD
    References a pre-allocated DD in the job that is
    a NETRC file.
    * NETRC file format is:
      MACHINE hostname LOGIN userid PASSWORD password

    e.g. NETRCDD NETRC

    *** the only allowed ddname is NETRC ***

NOPASSWORD
    Will generate a null/blank password

PASSWORD
    Password for remote userid

    e.g. PASSWORD xy89124

POSTFTP
   Defines one or more FTP commands to be executed
   after the PUT of the requested file.
   Separate commands with a comma and enclose
   in parenthesis if multiple or blanks.

   e.g POSTFTP (ls -la)

PREFTP
   Defines one or more FTP commands to be executed
   prior to the PUT of the requested file.
   Separate commands with a comma and enclose
   in parenthesis if multiple or blanks.

   e.g PREFTP (quote site recfm=fb lrecl=80)

TYPE
    Type of FTP
    BIN or Binary if sending to a non z/OS host
        in binary format
    TEXT or ASC if sending to a non z/OS host
        in plain text format
    MVS or ZOS if sending to a z/OS host

    e.g. TYPE MVS

UNIQUE
    Used to force a unique filename at the remote site.

USERID
    Userid for remote host
    * if anonymous then the password is generated

    e.g USERID yourid

Required Keywords:

   Host
   DSN
   Userid
   Netrc
   NetrcDD

Sample Batch Usage:

Example 1:

The following is a sample batch Terminal Monitor Program (TMP) that
demonstrates executing the FTPFromZ in batch to send a sequential data
set from one z/OS host to another.  The NETRCDD option is used and
references the NETRC in the job stream.

    //jobname  JOB  ...,
    //             MSGLEVEL=(1,1),MSGCLASS=X
    //TSOB     EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
    //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSEXEC  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.rexx.library
    //NETRC    DD *
    MACHINE zos.host.name LOGIN userid PASSWORD password
    //SYSTSIN  DD  *
    %ftpfromz dsn test.html +
        host zos.host.name +
        netrcdd +
        type mvs +
        file test.html2

Example 2:

The following is a sample batch Terminal Monitor Program (TMP) that
demonstrates executing the FTPFromZ in batch to send a two partitioned
data sets from one z/OS host to another.  The NETRCDD option is used and
references the NETRC in the job stream.

    //jobname  JOB  ...,
    //             MSGLEVEL=(1,1),MSGCLASS=X
    //TSOB     EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
    //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSTSPRT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSEXEC  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.rexx.library
    //NETRC    DD *
    MACHINE zos.host.name LOGIN userid PASSWORD password
    //SYSTSIN  DD  *
    %ftpfromz dsn test.exec host zos.host.name +
        preftp (quote site recfm=fb lrecl=80,mkdir test.exec) +
        mem * +
        netrcdd netrc +
        type mvs
    %ftpfromz dsn test.panels host zos.host.name +
        preftp (quote site recfm=fb lrecl=80,mkdir test.panels) +
        mem * +
        netrcdd netrc +
        type mvs

Example 3:

Sample command to send 2 members to a non-z/OS server:

     %ftpfromz dsn test.pds host 10.233.107.93 userid uid    +
     memsuf .txt type asc password pwd dir t mem (mem1 mem2)
