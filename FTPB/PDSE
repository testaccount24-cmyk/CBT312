If you want to use FTP to create a PDSE then you'll need to follow the
instructions from the IBM C/S IP Users Guide:

1.5.54  SITE Subcommand--Send Site-Specific Information to a Host


 |         A SITE DATACLASS command pointing to an SMS data class must be
 |         used to create a PDSE. A load module loading from a temporary
 |         dataset will always be a REPLACE operation, in that existing
 |         members will be overwritten in case of name conflicts. LMTR will
 |         not be performed in STOU mode (when SUNIQUE is turned on).

NOTE: FTP does NOT support PDSE Version 2 member generations.
