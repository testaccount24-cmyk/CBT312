+
+The NETRC file is used by FTP when allocated to the NETRC DD to provide
+the userid and password for a defined host (hostname or IP Address) without
+forcing a prompt by the FTP client.
+
+Commands:  %Insert (I)+to Insert a new hostname record
+           %CANCEL    +to Cancel all updates and exit
+           %EDit      +to Edit the NETRC dataset
+
+Selection: %S+         Select row to review/update
+           %D+         Delete the row
+           %R+         Repeat the row and allow update
+
+The NETRC dataset should be protected using the installed Security Manager
+to prevent others from reading it since it contains both userids and passwords
+in clear text.
+
+Note that this dialog will attempt to issue the appropriate commands to
+secure the dataset but you should verify that the dataset is actually
+protected (some sites lock users from issuing some security commands).
