~ This panel is used to prompt the user when a selected transfer has
~ been analyzed and determined that DFSMSdss should be used.
~
~ The information that you will be prompted to provide is:
~
% Exclusive use of data set(s) during unload:+
~
~%Yes~means that during the unload you require exclusive use of the
~ dataset(s).  No other batch or online job/user will be allowed to
~ use it while your transfer unload is running.  Nor will your job run
~ until it can gain exclusive access.
~
~%No~means that you don't require exclusive ownership of the
~ dataset(s) and is the suggested value.
~
% Replace the data set(s) during reload:
~
~%Yes~means that if the dataset exists at the remote site already that
~ you want to replace it with this transfer
~
~%No~means that if the dataset already exists to leave it alone and
~ not to replace it.
~
% Dump/Restore to Tape:
~
~%No~means that the dump and restore will use dasd (default)
~
~%Yes~means that you want to dump to tape and thus restore from tape
~
% Optional Restore Options~are provided in case you need them.
~
%    Volser
~
~    If you want to restore the dataset(s) to a specific volume enter
~    that volser here.
~
%    Management Class, blank, or NONE
~
~    If you want to override the existing SMS Management Class or have
~    the existing class ignored specify it here.  A class name will
~    cause that new Management class to be used during the restore.
~    NONE may be coded to indicate no Management class is to be used.
~
%    Storage Class, blank, or NONE
~
~    If you want to override the existing SMS Storage Class or have
~    the existing class ignored specify it here.  A class name will
~    cause that new Storage class to be used during the restore.  NONE
~    may be coded to indicate no Storage class is to be used.
