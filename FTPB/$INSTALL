Installation

This application is distributed in a PDS with the primary members (EXEC
and PANELS) in TSO Transmit (IDTF) format.  To use this dialog you
need to issue TSO EXEC 'restored.dsname(RECEIVE)' which will convert
the EXEC and PANELS members into an EXEC library and a PANELS library
from which you can copy them into other datasets.

There will be 7 members:

   $DOC     -  What you are now reading
   CHANGES  -  What's changed
   EXEC     -  The REXX Execs in TSO Transmit format.
   NETRC    -  Information on using a personal NETRC data set.
   PANELS   -  The ISPF Panels in TSO Transmit format.
   PDSE     -  Information on how to send PDSE data sets
   RECEIVE  -  used to receive members EXEC and PANELS into
               partitioned datasets

After creating the installation data set:

1.  Process members EXEC and PANELS using the RECEIVE exec as described
    above.

2.  Copy FTPB.PANELS into an ISPF Panel library in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

3.  Copy FTPB.EXEC into a library in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.

    These REXX procedures are written to be installed in a library that is
    DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80) or one that is DCB=(RECFM=VB,LRECL=255) to
    support the format of your SYSEXEC or SYSPROC libraries.

4.  Edit the FTPBCUST exec and make make any updates as required for your
    installation.

5.  Panel FTPBHF2 needs to be updated with your TCP/IP Host names
    **** IMPORTANT ****

6.  Read the documentation on how to enable FILETYPE=JES, both the
    configuration (FTP.DATA) and security implications. This is used
    when doing an FTP of multiple datasets which uses ADRDSSU and
    submits a batch job via FTP.

7.  Test by entering from the ISPF Command line:  TSO %FTPB

Comments, questions, suggestions can be directed to (please mention the
release of the code you are using):

Fun note:  Enter a source dsname of "egg" and see what happens.
